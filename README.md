# Forkful

> Version control for recipes.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rompingstalactite/rompingstalactite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rompingstalactite/rompingstalactite)

Forkful lets chefs track previous iterations of recipes by allowing them view a recipe's version history. By "forking" an existing recipe, chefs can copy and edit the list of ingredients and steps. If a recipe is missing, they can create their own and allow others to modify it. Forkful is a great way for chefs to collaborate on and improve a recipe.

See the app live at [forkful.io](www.forkful.io) and get started!

### Schema Design

## Requirements

- Node 5.8.0
- PostgreSQL 9.5.1

## Development


### Keys

You'll need API keys for [Google Plus](https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/oauth#acquiring-and-using-an-api-key) and [Filestack](https://www.filestack.com/plans). Create files in `server/keys/` called `googleAuth.js` and `filePicker.js` following the format of the example files.

Forkful uses session-based authentication, so you'll need to set cookie and session secrets in `server/keys/expressSecrets.js`. An example is provided for you.

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```
npm install -g webpack nodemon
npm install
```

### Running Locally

Make sure you have PostgreSQL running and that the database has been initialized.
Set up your database by running the following inside your root directory:

```
npm run db-setup
```
Then, run the development server with:

```
npm run dev-start
```

Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Testing

To run all tests:
```
npm test

```

To run only the client-side tests:
```
npm run test:client

```

To run only the server-side tests:
```
npm run test:server

```

### Roadmap

What are we working on now? View the project roadmap [here](https://github.com/rompingstalactite/rompingstalactite/issues).

## Production

### Running in Production

Make sure you have PostgreSQL running and that the database has been initialized.
If the database has not been initialized, run:

```
npm run db-setup
```

Then, from within the root directory:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The app will run on the port defined in `process.env.PORT` or default to port 8080.
